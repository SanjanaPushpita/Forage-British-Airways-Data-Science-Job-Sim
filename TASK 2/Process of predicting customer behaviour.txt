1. Import libraries
2. REading the csv file and stor it into data
3. seeing the info of the data
4. seeing the description of the data..count,mean std etc of every numerical column
5. then taking the unique value from the flight_day column, which is the day name..
6. then map those days into numeric and store it into a new column name flight_day_num
7. just check the data.desccribe()
-----------
8. data['num_passengers'].value_counts()
    #checking booking counts..like The most common booking involves 1 passenger , occurring 31,352 times .
9. make a bar plot for it
10. then make a pie chart
----
11..similar like 8,9,10...you have to do it for- sales_channel, trip_type, length_of_stay, flight_hour, flight_day, route, booking_origin, wants_extra_baggage, wants_preferred_seat, wants_in_flight_meals, flight_duration, booking_complete. completeing all the column one by one

IN THIS WAY WE CAN VISUALIZE THE GIVEN DATA
----------------- 
12. Encode sales_channel and trip_type using label encoder, store into a new column and add it to data using map function
13. count the calues of both of them after encoding
----------------
Now modelling the data
as we have added few of new columns to the data
14. going to drom the old columns, which was used to make clear , cleaned data, as they are not needed anymore
15. make a variable, and store those unnecessary columns
16. Use drop function to delete those columns
17. Finally convert the cleaned data to csv file

--------
18. TRAIN AND TEST THE DATA WITH REGRESSION MODELS ,FIND MSE AND R SQUARE OF EACH MODEL
19. MAKE A BAR CHART OF.. Top 10 Features having impact on booking_complete (recognised by {model_name})
-----
19. 18. TRAIN AND TEST THE DATA WITH CLASSIFICATION MODELS ,FIND CLASSIFICATION TABLE FOR EACH MODEL
19. MAKE A BAR CHART OF.. Top 10 Features having impact on booking_complete (recognised by {model_name})
