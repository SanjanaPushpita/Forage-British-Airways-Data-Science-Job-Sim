Common groups include: 
	*Time of day: Early morning, mid-day, evening departures.
	*Type of route: Short-haul vs. long-haul
	*Region or destination group: Europe, North America, Asia, etc.

Youâ€™ll estimate what proportion of passengers in each group are likely to be eligible for:
	*Tier 1: Concorde Room
	*Tier 2: First Lounge
	*Tier 3: Club Lounge

** goal is to create a lookup table that estimates lounge eligibility using clear, scalable categories
